EXAMPLE LOCATION

This is an example script for the dialogue system game's.
The game will load this file into the game to generate dialogues between
characters.

Text lines like this are ignored, the purpose of them is to explain where
characters are, context for the story, or anything that you can think of that
can be useful.

To create a dialogue that will load into the game you need to start the line you
can use the following format:

Use # to specify the name id of the dialogue
Use @ for the name of the character
Use - after author name to write the message
Use > for the reply of the player
Use / for comments

Here is an example of a dialogue that will load into the game

# exampleDialogueID
@ foo - hello, this is the first message of character foo
@ foo - this is the second one

/ This line is just a comment that will be ignored
@ foo - this is one can be replied, by the player
> hi, I'm the player
> I can reply to foo with different options
> this is a third option

@ bar - I'm another character, dialogues can have multiple characters
@ bar - But the only one that can reply is the player
@ bar - Player replies can be nested
@ bar - This means a character can reply after player selects an answer
> first answer
  @ bar - so you picked the first answer
  > yes
  > I guess
> second answer
  @ bar - so you picked the second answer
  > no
    @ bar - oh! okay
    > cool
  > sometimes I do that
    @ bar - I see
    > see you
@ bar - and this is the end of the dialogue
